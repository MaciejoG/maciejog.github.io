                Cassy took to the slopes with glee<br />
                She was excited to learn how to ski<br />
                But as she glided down the mountain side<br />
                She couldn't help but glide and slide<br />
                <br />
                She tumbled and she fell<br />
                But Maciej was there, he rang the bell<br />
                He rescued her and set her straight<br />
                And off she went, it wasn't too late<br />
                <br />
                She laughed and she played<br />
                As she worked on the tricks she still needed to grade<br />
                With Maciej by her side<br />
                She no longer feared the snowy slide<br />
                <br />
                As the ski day came to a close<br />
                Cassy and Maciej headed to apres-ski, as they chose.<br />
                They shared a romantic dinner and a sauna,<br />
                Their bond only grew stronger, without any drama.<br />
                <br />
                Now Cassy skis with grace and poise<br />
                She's conquered her fears and found her joys<br />
                On the mountain, she is free<br />
                And skiing became a part of her identity<br />
